```lua
require("speech_to_text.recorder").setup({
  -- Default recorder settings
  output_directory = "/tmp/nvim_speech_to_text",  -- Directory to save recordings
  file_format = "wav",                           -- Audio format
  sample_rate = "44100",                         -- Sample rate in Hz
  bit_depth = "16",                              -- Bit depth

  -- Transcription settings
  transcriber = {
    endpoint = "http://localhost:9000/asr",      -- URL of the transcription API
    task = "transcribe",                         -- Transcription task type
    encode = true,                               -- Encode audio for the API
    language = "en",                             -- Default language
    output = "txt"                               -- Output format
  }
})
```

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `:StartRecording`      | Begin recording audio             |
| `:StopRecording`       | Stop and save the recording       |
| `:CancelRecording`     | Cancel recording and delete file  |
| `:SelectInputDevice`   | Select audio input device         |
| `:PlayRecording`       | Browse and play saved recordings  |
| `:SelectAudioPlayer`   | Choose audio playback application |
| `:TranscribeRecording` | Select recording to transcribe    |
| `:TranscribeRecent`    | Transcribe most recent recording  |

## Default Keymaps

The plugin sets up these default keymaps:

| Keymap       | Description                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `<leader>sr` | Start recording                  |
| `<leader>ss` | Stop recording                   |
| `<leader>sc` | Cancel recording                 |
| `<leader>si` | Select input device              |
| `<leader>sp` | Play recording                   |
| `<leader>sa` | Select audio player              |
| `<leader>st` | Transcribe recording             |
| `<leader>sT` | Transcribe most recent recording |

## Usage

### Basic Workflow:

1. Start a recording with `:StartRecording` or `<leader>sr`
2. Speak into your microphone
3. Stop the recording with `:StopRecording` or `<leader>ss`
4. Transcribe it with `:TranscribeRecent` or `<leader>sT`
5. The transcription will appear in a floating window
6. From there, you can:
   - Press `i` to insert at cursor position
   - Press `a` to append to current buffer
   - Press `b` to open in a new buffer
   - Press `y` to copy to clipboard
   - Press `q` or `<Esc>` to close

### Selecting Input Device

If you have multiple microphones, use `:SelectInputDevice` or `<leader>si` to choose which one to record from.

### Managing Recordings

Use `:PlayRecording` or `<leader>sp` to browse your saved recordings. From this view, you can:

- Select a recording to play it
- Press `<c-d>` to delete a recording

### Changing Audio Player

The plugin supports multiple audio playback applications. Use `:SelectAudioPlayer` or `<leader>sa` to choose between:

- FFplay (default)
- mpv
- VLC (cvlc)

## Setting Up a Transcription API

For the transcription functionality to work, you need a compatible API service running. The plugin is configured to work with ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) APIs that accept POST requests with audio files.

You can use open-source solutions like:

- [Whisper API](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (local server)
- [Coqui STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT)

Configure the endpoint in the setup function.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and in your PATH
- Verify that PulseAudio or PipeWire-PulseAudio is installed and running
- Check that your microphone is working with other applications
- For transcription issues, verify that your API endpoint is accessible
